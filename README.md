from this app , i have learnd :
1) local database
2) blocObserver
3) how to deal with hive package
4) use intl package which can get date only (yy-mm-dd) from DateTime.now() 
5) HiveObject : if you create your model extends HiveObject , then you get some features as delete() and save() ,  ex : note.delete() , note is deleted 
6) in edit view : using controller in TextFormField to init the text
